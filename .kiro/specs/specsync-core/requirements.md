# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SpecSync is a commit-driven reliability layer that ensures specifications, code, tests, and documentation remain synchronized throughout the development lifecycle. The system acts as a quality gate at commit-time, preventing drift between these critical artifacts by leveraging Kiro's agentic capabilities to detect and resolve inconsistencies before commits are finalized.

## Glossary

- **SpecSync System**: The complete commit-time quality gate system including MCP tools, Kiro hooks, and validation logic
- **Staged Diff**: The set of file changes that have been staged for commit using `git add`
- **Drift**: Inconsistency between specifications, code implementation, tests, and documentation
- **Quality Gate**: A checkpoint that validates alignment before allowing a commit to proceed
- **MCP Tool**: Model Context Protocol tool that provides git context to Kiro
- **Commit Hook**: An automated trigger that executes Kiro validation during the commit process
- **Alignment**: The state where specs, code, tests, and documentation accurately reflect each other
- **Auto-Remediation**: A mode where SpecSync generates tasks to fix drift instead of blocking commits
- **Auto-Fix Mode**: A fully automated mode where Kiro agent automatically fixes drift and creates follow-up commits
- **Kiro Credits**: Usage-based credits required for AI-powered auto-fix operations

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my commits to be automatically validated for spec-code-test-doc alignment, so that I can prevent drift from entering the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer initiates a commit, THE SpecSync System SHALL trigger validation before the commit is finalized
2. WHEN validation detects alignment, THE SpecSync System SHALL allow the commit to proceed without intervention
3. WHEN validation detects drift, THE SpecSync System SHALL block the commit and provide specific feedback about misalignments
4. WHEN the commit process is triggered, THE SpecSync System SHALL complete validation within 30 seconds for typical changesets
5. WHEN validation runs, THE SpecSync System SHALL preserve all staged changes regardless of validation outcome

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an MCP tool that provides git context to Kiro, so that the agent can understand what changes are being committed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP tool is invoked, THE SpecSync System SHALL read the staged diff using `git diff --cached`
2. WHEN the MCP tool is invoked, THE SpecSync System SHALL detect the current branch using `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
3. WHEN the MCP tool retrieves git context, THE SpecSync System SHALL return structured data including branch name, staged files, and diff content
4. WHEN git commands fail, THE SpecSync System SHALL return error messages that indicate the specific failure reason
5. WHEN the repository is in a detached HEAD state, THE SpecSync System SHALL report the commit SHA instead of a branch name

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro to automatically detect drift between specs and code, so that I can fix inconsistencies before they are committed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN staged changes modify code files, THE SpecSync System SHALL compare the changes against the corresponding spec definitions
2. WHEN code changes introduce new functions or endpoints not in the spec, THE SpecSync System SHALL flag these as drift
3. WHEN code changes remove functionality defined in the spec, THE SpecSync System SHALL flag these as drift
4. WHEN code changes align with spec definitions, THE SpecSync System SHALL report successful alignment
5. WHEN multiple files are staged, THE SpecSync System SHALL validate each file against its corresponding spec section

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro to validate that tests cover the committed code changes, so that I maintain test coverage as the codebase evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are staged, THE SpecSync System SHALL identify which test files should cover the modified code
2. WHEN test files are missing for new code, THE SpecSync System SHALL flag missing test coverage
3. WHEN test files exist but do not cover new functionality, THE SpecSync System SHALL flag insufficient coverage
4. WHEN tests adequately cover code changes, THE SpecSync System SHALL report successful test alignment
5. WHEN test files are modified, THE SpecSync System SHALL validate that tests still align with both code and spec

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro to ensure documentation reflects committed changes, so that documentation stays current with the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes affect public APIs or interfaces, THE SpecSync System SHALL verify corresponding documentation exists
2. WHEN documentation describes functionality that differs from staged code, THE SpecSync System SHALL flag documentation drift
3. WHEN new features are added to code, THE SpecSync System SHALL verify documentation describes these features
4. WHEN code changes remove features, THE SpecSync System SHALL verify documentation no longer references removed features
5. WHEN documentation accurately reflects staged changes, THE SpecSync System SHALL report successful documentation alignment

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Kiro to suggest fixes for detected drift, so that I can quickly resolve alignment issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN drift is detected, THE SpecSync System SHALL generate specific suggestions for resolving each misalignment
2. WHEN spec updates are needed, THE SpecSync System SHALL propose exact spec modifications
3. WHEN test updates are needed, THE SpecSync System SHALL propose test additions or modifications
4. WHEN documentation updates are needed, THE SpecSync System SHALL propose documentation changes
5. WHEN multiple drift issues exist, THE SpecSync System SHALL prioritize suggestions by impact and provide them in a logical order

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want steering rules that guide Kiro's validation behavior, so that the system follows project-specific conventions and standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro performs validation, THE SpecSync System SHALL apply rules defined in the steering document
2. WHEN steering rules specify correlation patterns, THE SpecSync System SHALL use these patterns to map code files to spec sections
3. WHEN steering rules define minimal change policies, THE SpecSync System SHALL limit suggestions to only necessary modifications
4. WHEN steering rules are updated, THE SpecSync System SHALL apply new rules to subsequent validations without requiring system restart
5. WHEN steering rules conflict with detected drift, THE SpecSync System SHALL prioritize alignment over rule preferences and notify the developer

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple FastAPI example service managed by SpecSync, so that I can see the system working with real code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the example service is deployed, THE SpecSync System SHALL include a FastAPI application with at least two endpoints
2. WHEN the example service spec is defined, THE SpecSync System SHALL include endpoint definitions, request/response schemas, and behavior descriptions
3. WHEN the example service code is modified, THE SpecSync System SHALL validate changes against the service spec
4. WHEN the example service is committed, THE SpecSync System SHALL verify tests exist for all endpoints
5. WHEN the example service documentation is generated, THE SpecSync System SHALL include API endpoint descriptions derived from the spec


### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want SpecSync to automatically fix drift using Kiro's AI agent, so that I can maintain alignment without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-fix mode is enabled and drift is detected, THE SpecSync System SHALL invoke Kiro agent to automatically fix all drift issues
2. WHEN Kiro agent fixes drift, THE SpecSync System SHALL update specifications with missing endpoint or function definitions
3. WHEN Kiro agent fixes drift, THE SpecSync System SHALL generate comprehensive unit tests for new functionality
4. WHEN Kiro agent fixes drift, THE SpecSync System SHALL create or update documentation for new features
5. WHEN Kiro agent completes fixes, THE SpecSync System SHALL create a separate commit with all auto-generated changes
6. WHEN auto-fix is requested, THE SpecSync System SHALL estimate and display the number of credits required
7. WHEN user has insufficient credits, THE SpecSync System SHALL fall back to task generation mode
8. WHEN auto-fix commit is created, THE SpecSync System SHALL use a recognizable commit message format indicating automated fixes
9. WHEN auto-fix mode is configured to amend, THE SpecSync System SHALL add fixes to the original commit instead of creating a separate commit
10. WHEN auto-fix is complete, THE SpecSync System SHALL preserve clean git history with clear attribution of automated changes

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure SpecSync's behavior modes, so that I can choose between blocking, task generation, or full automation based on my workflow needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SpecSync configuration is loaded, THE SpecSync System SHALL support three modes: blocking, task generation, and auto-fix
2. WHEN blocking mode is enabled, THE SpecSync System SHALL prevent commits with drift and require manual fixes
3. WHEN task generation mode is enabled, THE SpecSync System SHALL allow commits and generate a remediation tasks file
4. WHEN auto-fix mode is enabled, THE SpecSync System SHALL allow commits and automatically fix drift using Kiro agent
5. WHEN configuration is changed, THE SpecSync System SHALL apply new settings on the next validation without requiring restart
6. WHEN auto-fix mode is enabled, THE SpecSync System SHALL check for required user permissions and credits before proceeding
7. WHEN user switches modes, THE SpecSync System SHALL provide clear feedback about the active mode and its behavior
